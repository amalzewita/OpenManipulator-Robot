### Overview:

The given script provides a trajectory planner for a robotic arm in a ROS environment. The script calculates joint angles using third-order polynomial planning and then actuates the robot accordingly. Additionally, it provides commands to control a gripper's opening and closing.

### Import Dependencies:

1. `rospy`: ROS Python library to write ROS nodes in Python.
2. `std_msgs.msg`: Standard ROS messages for basic data types.
3. `numpy`: Numeric library for mathematical operations.

### Function Definitions:

1. `grip()`: 
    - Commands the gripper to close.
    - Sets the gripper position to `-0.1` and the grip status to `True`.

2. `release()`: 
    - Commands the gripper to open.
    - Sets the gripper position to `0.1` and the grip status to `False`.

3. `third_order_trajectory_planning(tf, thetai, thetaf)`:
    - Computes coefficients for a third-order polynomial trajectory.
    - Given start and end angles (`thetai`, `thetaf`) and total time (`tf`), it returns the coefficients of the third-order polynomial.

### Main Execution:

1. Initialize a ROS node named "trajectory_planner_node".
2. Set up ROS publishers:
    - Gripper position and grip control.
    - Joint position control for joints 1, 2, and 4.

3. **1st Trajectory Plan**:
    - Calculates coefficients for a 3rd order polynomial joint space trajectory.
    - Moves the robot by calculating joint angles and sending commands to each joint using the obtained coefficients.
    - After the movement, it commands the robot to grip an object.

4. **2nd Trajectory Plan**:
    - Calculates another set of coefficients for the joints.
    - Moves the robot by calculating joint angles and sending commands to each joint using the new coefficients.
    - Upon arrival at the destination, the robot releases the object.

5. There's a stabilization sleep time before the script termination.

### Key Notes:

1. Third-order polynomial trajectory planning is used here as it ensures not just start and end positions, but also initial and final velocities to be zero, which can provide a smooth trajectory for robotic arms.
2. Joint commands are sent in discrete time steps, as defined by the `dt` variable.
3. Gripping and releasing functions can be extended for more complex operations or for different types of grippers.

### Usage:

To use this node, ensure that you have the required topics active and that the robot can respond to the commands sent on these topics. Always ensure safety precautions when operating robotic arms to prevent accidents.

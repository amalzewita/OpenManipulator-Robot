## Introduction

This project aims to control the ROBOTIS OPEN-MANIPULATOR in the GAZEBO simulator using ROS and Python. Teams are tasked with positioning the robot and an associated task object within the simulator. The goal is to predict the robot's location, move it to the object's location, pick up the object, and relocate it elsewhere to complete the task.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1

Objective: Calculate the robot's location using forward kinematics and compare this to the actual ground truth location in RViz.

### Milestone 2

Objective: Navigate the robot to three randomly generated locations (determined during runtime) using inverse kinematics. Validate whether the robot successfully reaches these destinations in RViz.

### Milestone 3

Objective: Design an environment within GAZEBO that includes the robot, tables, and a task object. The robot should then relocate the task object from one position to another, ensuring there are no collisions during the process.
